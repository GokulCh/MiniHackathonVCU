Hello and welcome to this video, today we're going to talk about a Java code that can convert images into text.
This technology is called Optical Character Recognition or OCR, and it's changing the way we interact with images and documents.

So let's take a closer look at the code. This code is using the Tesseract library to perform OCR on images.
It starts by specifying the path to the images and the location of the Tesseract data files.
Then, it creates an HTML file to display the results, with a header and a title, and loops through all the PNG files in the specified directory.
For each file, it performs the OCR, and writes the result to the HTML file, along with a reference to the input image.

So let's see this in action. Here, I have some images that we'll convert to text using this code.
We'll start by running the code, and as you can see, it's processing the images and creating an HTML file with the results.

Now, let's take a look at the HTML file. Here, you can see that each image has been processed,
and the text has been extracted and displayed next to the image. This is just a simple example, but imagine the possibilities.
With this code, you can convert any image into text, making it much easier to process and analyze data.

So that's it, a quick overview of the code that converts images into text. If you're interested in learning more about OCR and how it can help you,
